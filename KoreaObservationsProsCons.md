The following idea came to me while on my visit in South Korea in 2020: "Share experiences (tagged) on what you like (and dislike) about what certain cultures are doing."

There's a lot to learn from one another and as a frequent traveler I observe many things. This is a way of sharing these observations. Probably in the future I will add further sections to this or expand it in other ways.

Here's some Pros and Cons from my time in South Korea. For the first month or so the collection happened in my Evernote note. This is the first time I'm sharing it publicly.

**Note**: These are my private observations. They are very opinionated and are written from the unique perspective I have on life growing up the way I grew up in the environment I grew up in. None of this is universal and I can fully understand that there are other ways of seeing things.

## PROs:
* great nature trails for people to experience nature
* flawless internet everywhere
* Baggage Claim so fast! As international traveller I’m not used to that speed
* Easy use of public transport with tmoney card also protecting privacy. Works everywhere.
* Great public transport in many areas. Very modern with live updates (not really 100% in jeju)
* Artwork in front of new buildings
* Buses, inexpensive and very comfortable "business class" available. Plus buses are usually on time.
* Trains, subways usually on time with very little delay. Only one time in Gangnam a bus that was supposed to stop at the bus stop didn’t because crowded with other busses.
* Water filter stations in most guesthouses and hotels.
* Koreans can be very fast in accomplishing things in business.

## CONs:
* Waste of water in urinals. Haven't seen use of waterless urinals at all.
* barbed-wire in nature (along trails) to keep people on track
* many government systems do not support open standards, open source etc. You often have to deal with proprietary operating systems to access bank systems, government services etc.
* Excessive parking on sidewalks. These are sidewalks, not parking lots!
* Delivery (Vespa) scooters that use sidewalks and endanger people
* Zebra crossings not respected
* Rooftops in the cities are mostly untapped resources. How can real estate be so expensive but some of the prime locations (top floors, roofs) be unused. You could build more rooftop bars + restaurants, install rooftop gardens, solar, ...
* Horrible (not only digital) user interfaces. This can be so frustrating. From elevators over online banking to mobile interfaces. So many bad examples!
* 1st class KTX has very limited charging per seat. If you need to work and charge while on the go, better take 2nd class (1 charger per 2 seats) or use extender.
* A/C in hotels only allows heating in winter time, even 5-star hotels. Temperature in mid-20s can make sleeping close to impossible.
* Regulation to show a doctor's certificate (no Covid-19 symptoms) to receive your visa which allows entry for up to 90 days.
