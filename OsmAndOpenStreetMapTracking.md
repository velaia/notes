# My OpenStreetMap Setup 2020

OpenStreetMap mapping has been a passion of mine for over a decade. My friend [Adrian](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/nitegate) must have introduced me to it some time around 2007 - 2009.

[velaia](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/velaia) is my OpenStreetMap account.

As I only occasionally map, my setup is very simple. I use [OsmAnd](https://osmand.net/) for my Google Pixel 3 smartphone and track the files. Then I either upload them to OpenStreetMap through the app (and re-download them on my laptop) or copy them over to my laptop via USB. On the laptop I use a simple JOSM-setup together with frequent lookups of the [OpenStreetMap Wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/) to get the mapping done. Most of my contributions are simple tracks and trails or POIs I encounter during my travels, hikes, runs and bike rides. JSOM might not be the most modern or simple to use editor but it has served me well over the years and has a very stable API (also for keyboard shortcuts) so I don't have to constantly relearn new tools. Here can find a [JOSM Getting Started Guide](https://learnosm.org/en/josm/start-josm/).

Here are a couple of screenshots to illustrate the use and configuration of the application. NB: I have not paid for the OsmAnd application but it lets you install a limited number of maps. So what I've done is download the map of the area I'm mapping and taking it as a reference to see which trails are already mapped and which ones I still need to map when I encounter them.

To start GPX logging you need to activate the **Trip recording** plugin and configure the screen to show the **GPX logging** element:

If you want to ability to upload the GPX tracks directly from the app to your OpenStreetMap account also activate the **OpenStreetMap editing** plugin as shown in the Plugins screenshot above and then adjust the configuration of the plugin to add your **OSM username and password**. You need an OpenStreetMap account for this to work.
