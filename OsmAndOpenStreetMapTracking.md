# My OpenStreetMap Setup 2020

OpenStreetMap mapping has been a passion of mine for over a decade. My friend [Adrian](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/nitegate) must have introduced me to it some time around 2007 - 2009.

[velaia](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/velaia) is my OpenStreetMap account.

As I only occasionally map, my setup is very simple. I use [OsmAnd](https://osmand.net/) for my Google Pixel 3 smartphone and track the files. Then I either upload them to OpenStreetMap through the app (and re-download them on my laptop) or copy them over to my laptop via USB. On the laptop I use a simple JOSM-setup together with frequent lookups of the [OpenStreetMap Wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/) to get the mapping done. Most of my contributions are simple tracks and trails or POIs I encounter during my travels, hikes, runs and bike rides. JSOM might not be the most modern or simple to use editor but it has served me well over the years and has a very stable API (also for keyboard shortcuts) so I don't have to constantly relearn new tools. Here can find a [JOSM Getting Started Guide](https://learnosm.org/en/josm/start-josm/).

Here are a couple of screenshots to illustrate the use and configuration of the application. NB: I have not paid for the OsmAnd application so I don't see any maps while editing - usually I use the MAPS.ME application for checking whether the trails I'm exploring already exist in OSM:
