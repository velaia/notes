# What are good and what are bad uses of smartphones?

**How do I want to use my smartphone in the future?**
* As little as possible. Keep it out of reach most of the time.
* Definitely not after getting up or within 2 hours of going to sleep.
* As a hotspot to get my laptop on the internet
* For video and voice calls.
* For the occasional photo and backing them up (thinking about using a dedicated camera instead)
* For reading ebooks and listening to audiobooks.
* For my meditation practise.
* To listen to music (and videos, even though videos are better on the big screen).
* For note taking and backing up receipts etc (Evernote).
* For checking appointments and calendars.
* For contributing to OpenStreetMap.
* As a travel support (maps, Airbnb)
* For some fintech banking apps which don’t have a web version (even if I’d prefer the web version)
* For the optimize.me +1s
* Sometimes for Strava tracking (though not for most of my workouts where I don’t bring my phone). Not using it for Strava social engagement.



**Go through list of apps you use and decide which ones will stay and which will have to go.
Stay (and why)**:
* Buddhify: helps me with my meditation practice
* Evernote: helps me with note taking and organising all my documents, files, ...
* Dashlane: keeps my passwords safe
* Maps: Google, MAPS.ME, OsmAnd: Help me find my way around and contribute to OpenStreetMap
* Calendar: Helps me stay organised + has reminders that automate things for me
* Google Translate: Helps me translate when overseas
* Google Authenticator: Helps with 2FA
* Podcasts: Valuable content, very well designed app (Tim Ferriss, Farnam Street, Freakonomics, TWiML&AI, Talks at Google
* WhatsApp: Very distracting. Not 100% sure yet. Maybe good to pull information from the family. Communicate though that you’re only checking once a week to important people. Don’t use for fresh relationships which might lead to misunderstandings
* Google Contacts: Good for organising and backing up contacts
* Amazon Kindle: For reading
* Audible: For audiobooks
* Barcode scanner: For scanning contacts etc.
* Photos: For backing up photos and showing them to people I meet
* ExpressVPN: Helpful for some countries and some activities
* Wire: keep it for Video calls. Check once a week otherwise.
* Skype: Keep it. Useful for calling phones overseas.
* Hopper, Priority Pass, Uber, Airbnb, car2go: Helpful for travel and quick check-ins (Airbnb)
Have to go (and why):
* Goodreads: Enough to have it on the computer, don’t need it on the phone. Better to use on a big screen.
* Whova: Not needed anymore. Was only relevant for NeurIPS and I’ve connected to the people there afterwards. Maybe keep it for a while to follow-up on papers etc. (which can also be done through the website. So I think it should go)
* Dropbox: I don’t use it (a lot) and can use it on the Desktop instead.
* Slack: Don’t use it at all (on the phone). Also when/if I start using it I should use it on the Desktop.
